# 🎨 HSV Color Visualizer using OpenCV

An interactive Python tool to visualize and understand how HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values translate to RGB/BGR colors using OpenCV trackbars.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project creates a simple GUI window where users can dynamically adjust HSV values via sliders (trackbars) and instantly see the resulting color in the BGR format.

It is ideal for:
- Learning about HSV color space
- Testing color thresholds for computer vision tasks
- Color tuning in real-time for OpenCV projects

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
